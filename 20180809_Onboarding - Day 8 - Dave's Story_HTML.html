<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">Dear ##name##,</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">I was a caregiver for my mother for 10 years. For two years, she lived with me and my family. I had siblings but I was the primary caregiver while mom lived with me. I did everything. She was so weak and frail.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">And caring for her was complex. She had just had surgery removing part of her lung from lung cancer. She also had COPD and heart failure.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;"><b>It gets worse</b></p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">My job required me to travel a lot and I&#39;d be gone for a week at a time multiple times a year. That first year, mom was in and out of the hospital 12 times. I just couldn&#39;t keep her out.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">Despite that first dismal year, I eventually got mom healthy enough to live in her own home. During the second year she lived with me, she had zero hospitalizations! And that was after averaging one a month.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">On top of that, I performed well at my job during that time earning multiple bonuses.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;"><b>So the question is</b></p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">How did I do it?</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">How did I get my mom back to health where she could live in her home after not being able to keep her out of the hospital?</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">And more importantly, how can you do the same thing?</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">After that personal experience with my mom and interviewing dozens of primary family caregivers, I recognized a pattern. Successful caregivers have one major thing in common.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;"><b>They follow a very clear process</b></p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;"><a href="http://care3.co/want-to-be-a-better-caregiver-follow-these-3-steps">Read the Case Study</a></p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">In this case study, I show you the step-by-step process I followed to help mom get healthy enough to live in her own home.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">I call the process that successful caregivers do to keep their loved ones as healthy as possible, <em>The Care3 Way:&nbsp;Have a Team. Make A Plan. Communicate for Action</em>.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:150%;">Learn how I and other successful caregivers did it. You can, too!</p>
